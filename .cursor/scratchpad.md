# USDC Mockup Refactoring Progress

## Background and Motivation
The user requested refactoring opportunities in the `BridgeForm.tsx` file to improve code organization without impacting functionality or complicating the architecture.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Critical Security Issue Fixed: Refund Address Management
**Problem Identified**: The IBC transaction system was creating two different disposable addresses:
1. `disposableWrapper` â†’ used as IBC sender (`ownerAddressForWrapper`)
2. `disposable` â†’ used as refund target (`refundTarget`)

**Security Risk**: If funds were refunded to the `refundTarget` address, users couldn't access them because the private key wasn't available in the extension.

**Cleanup Issue**: The cleanup logic was trying to remove `refundTarget` but the actual address persisted in the extension was `ownerAddressForWrapper`, causing refund addresses to accumulate.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Use a single disposable signer for both wrapper and refund target
- Set `refundTarget = disposableWrapper.address` to ensure consistency
- This ensures we can access refunded funds and clean up the correct address

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Critical Security Fix Completed
**Issue**: Refund addresses were accumulating in the Namada extension because:
1. Two different disposable addresses were being created
2. Cleanup was targeting the wrong address
3. This created a security risk where refunded funds could be inaccessible

**Solution**: 
- Modified both `sendNowViaOrbiterAction` and `debugOrbiterAction` in `bridgeActions.ts`
- Now use a single disposable signer for both IBC sender and refund target
- Set `refundTarget = disposableWrapper.address` to ensure consistency
- This ensures we can access refunded funds and clean up the correct address

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/bridge/services/bridgeActions.ts` - Fixed disposable signer usage

## Lessons

### Security and Architecture
- **Refund Address Management**: Always use the same disposable address for both IBC sender and refund target to ensure fund accessibility
- **State Management**: Use `getCurrentState` callback pattern to avoid stale state issues in async operations
- **Race Conditions**: Add appropriate delays when multiple async operations might interfere
- **Transaction Tracking**: Use stable transaction IDs and proper state management to prevent duplicates

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Extract business logic into service files, UI logic into components, and utilities into dedicated files
- **Custom Hooks**: Use hooks to encapsulate complex useEffect logic and make it reusable
- **Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies explicitly to extracted functions to maintain modularity
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user feedback and proper cleanup

### Testing and Debugging
- **Diagnostic Logging**: Include detailed logging for debugging complex async flows
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages and progress indicators
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle edge cases and provide fallbacks
