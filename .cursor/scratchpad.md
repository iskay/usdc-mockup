# USDC Mockup Refactoring Progress

## Background and Motivation
The user requested refactoring opportunities in the `BridgeForm.tsx` file to improve code organization without impacting functionality or complicating the architecture.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Critical Security Issue Fixed: Refund Address Management
**Problem Identified**: The IBC transaction system was creating two different disposable addresses:
1. `disposableWrapper` â†’ used as IBC sender (`ownerAddressForWrapper`)
2. `disposable` â†’ used as refund target (`refundTarget`)

**Security Risk**: If funds were refunded to the `refundTarget` address, users couldn't access them because the private key wasn't available in the extension.

**Cleanup Issue**: The cleanup logic was trying to remove `refundTarget` but the actual address persisted in the extension was `ownerAddressForWrapper`, causing refund addresses to accumulate.

**Solution Implemented**: 
- Use a single disposable signer for both wrapper and refund target
- Set `refundTarget = disposableWrapper.address` to ensure consistency
- This ensures we can access refunded funds and clean up the correct address

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests

### Critical Security Fix Completed
**Issue**: Refund addresses were accumulating in the Namada extension because:
1. Two different disposable addresses were being created
2. Cleanup was targeting the wrong address
3. This created a security risk where refunded funds could be inaccessible

**Solution**: 
- Modified both `sendNowViaOrbiterAction` and `debugOrbiterAction` in `bridgeActions.ts`
- Now use a single disposable signer for both IBC sender and refund target
- Set `refundTarget = disposableWrapper.address` to ensure consistency
- This ensures we can access refunded funds and clean up the correct address

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/bridge/services/bridgeActions.ts` - Fixed disposable signer usage

### Enhanced Debug Logging for Shield Transaction Bech32m Error
**Issue**: Shield transactions were failing with "Error decoding from Bech32m: parsing failed" when a public key reveal was needed.

**Debug Enhancement**: Added comprehensive logging to help diagnose the Bech32m error:
- Added validation and logging in `isPublicKeyRevealed` function to handle empty addresses
- Added detailed logging in `buildTx` function around the `buildRevealPk` call
- Added input validation logging in both `txShield.ts` and `MaspBuildWorker.ts`
- Added logging to show account data, public key status, and wrapper transaction props

**Files Modified**:
- `src/workers/MaspBuildWorker.ts` - Added debug logging for public key reveal process
- `src/utils/txShield.ts` - Added debug logging for worker payload

### Fixed Shield Transaction Bech32m Error
**Root Cause**: The `publicKey` was being set to an empty string because we were only querying the RPC, which doesn't have the public key for new accounts that haven't revealed it yet.

**Solution**: 
- Modified `shieldNowForTokenAction` to fetch the public key from the Namada extension first
- Added fallback to RPC query if extension doesn't have the public key
- Added comprehensive logging to track public key retrieval
- The extension contains the actual bech32-encoded public key (starting with 'tpknam') needed for RevealPK transactions

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/bridge/services/bridgeActions.ts` - Fixed public key retrieval from extension

### Fixed Extension API Usage for Public Key Retrieval
**Issue**: The code was using the wrong method to get accounts from the Namada extension (`signer.getAccounts()` instead of `namada.accounts()`).

**Root Cause**: 
- We were trying to call `signer.getAccounts()` which doesn't exist
- The correct method is `namada.accounts()` as used in Namadillo
- Removed the RPC fallback since it's pointless - if the public key hasn't been revealed, the RPC won't have it either

**Solution**: 
- Changed from `signer.getAccounts()` to `namada.accounts()`
- Removed the RPC fallback logic
- Added better logging to show when no public key is found
- The extension is the source of truth for public keys

**Files Modified**:
- `src/features/bridge/services/bridgeActions.ts` - Fixed extension API usage

### Fixed Shielded Balance Calculation for Current Account
**Issue**: Shielded balances were always showing the balance of the first account, regardless of which account was currently selected.

**Root Cause**: 
- The `updateNamadaShieldedBalances` function in `balanceService.ts` was always using the first account with a viewing key
- It wasn't checking which account was currently selected in `state.addresses.namada.shielded`

**Solution**: 
- Modified `updateNamadaShieldedBalances` to first look for the account matching the current selected shielded address
- Added fallback to first account with viewing key if current account not found
- Added comprehensive logging to track which account is being used for balance calculation
- Now properly fetches shielded balances for the currently selected account

**Files Modified**:
- `src/services/balanceService.ts` - Fixed account selection for shielded balance calculation

## Lessons

### Security and Architecture
- **Refund Address Management**: Always use the same disposable address for both IBC sender and refund target to ensure fund accessibility
- **State Management**: Use `getCurrentState` callback pattern to avoid stale state issues in async operations
- **Race Conditions**: Add appropriate delays when multiple async operations might interfere
- **Transaction Tracking**: Use stable transaction IDs and proper state management to prevent duplicates

### Code Organization
- **Separation of Concerns**: Extract business logic into service files, UI logic into components, and utilities into dedicated files
- **Custom Hooks**: Use hooks to encapsulate complex useEffect logic and make it reusable
- **Dependency Injection**: Pass dependencies explicitly to extracted functions to maintain modularity
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling with user feedback and proper cleanup

### Testing and Debugging
- **Diagnostic Logging**: Include detailed logging for debugging complex async flows
- **User Feedback**: Provide clear error messages and progress indicators
- **Graceful Degradation**: Handle edge cases and provide fallbacks
